# A Dream Within a Dream
## Poe

Take this kiss
and in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream
Yet if home has flowed away
In a night or in a day
in a vision or in none
is it therefore the less gone
All that we see or seem
All but a dream within a dream

I stand amid a roar
of a surf shore

Another line in for both
And I hold within my toes
grains of annoying sand

Add a line for conflict (master)
